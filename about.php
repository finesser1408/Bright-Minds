<u>Welcome to My Bright-minds Poetry</u>
<br>
<br>
<u>Where Words Come Alive</u>
<br>
We are a poetry and word-weaving website from zimbabwe. We are thrilled to share our passion for poetry with you, and we hope you find inspiration and solace in the words that follow.
<br>
<br>
<u>Our Poetry Journey</u>
<br> 
Poetry has been our constant companion for 5 years, and it's helped many of our writers navigate the ups and downs of life. They find solace in the beauty of nature, the complexity of human emotions, and the power of language. Our poetry is a reflection of my experiences, observations, and dreams.
<br> 
<br>
<u>Influences & Inspirations</u>
<br> 
We are deeply influenced by the works of Ethel Cruger and the beauty of the natural world. I believe that poetry has the power to heal, inspire, and connect us in ways that transcend boundaries.
<br> 
<br>
<u>What to Expect</u>
<br> 
On this website, you'll find a collection of our poems, musings on the writing process, and occasional updates from our writing journey. I hope you'll find something that resonates with you, makes you think, or simply brings a smile to your face.
<br>
<br>
<u>Let's Connect</u>
<br>
If you'd like to stay in touch, please subscribe to our newsletter or follow us on social media. We would love to hear from you, share our work with you, and connect over our shared love of poetry.

<br>
<u>Thank You</u>
<br> 
Thank you for stopping by, and We hope you enjoy your time here. Remember, poetry is a journey, not a destination â€“ and I'm honored to have you along for the ride.
